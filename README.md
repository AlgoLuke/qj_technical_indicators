# Technical Indicators Library üöÄ

Welcome to the **Technical Indicators Library**, a high-performance, open-source collection of financial technical indicators. Originally developed as part of the [QuantJourney project](https://quantjourney.substack.com) by Jakub Polec, it‚Äôs now freely available for everyone to use, fork, and improve under the MIT License.

## üåü Features
- **Comprehensive Indicators**: Includes SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and many more.
- **Optimized Performance**: Powered by [Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) for fast calculations.
- **No TA-Lib Required**: Built from the ground up with NumPy, Pandas, and yfinance.
- **Execution Timing**: Features a decorator to measure and log computation times.
- **Open Source**: Licensed under MIT for unrestricted use in any project.

## üéØ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required packages: `numpy`, `pandas`, `yfinance`, `numba`, `matplotlib` (optional for plotting)

Install dependencies with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas yfinance numba matplotlib
```

### Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/QuantJourneyOrg/qj_technical_indicators.git
   cd qj_technical_indicators
   ```
2. Run the example script:
   ```bash
   python try_technical_indicators.py
   ```
   This fetches PL data from yfinance and computes indicators, logging execution times.
